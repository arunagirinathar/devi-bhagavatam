\chapter{On the superiority of Rudra over Vi\d{s}\d{n}u}

1-5. The \d{R}i\d{s}is said :-- ``The great legendary story, the life of \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a, supremely divine, destructive of all sins, has been narrated by you, O S\=uta! But, O Blessed One! You, though highly intelligent, have dwelt on it not at a great length; hence many doubts are cropping up in our minds. A very difficult tapasy\=a was performed by V\=asudeva the part incarnate of Vi\d{s}\d{n}u, who had to go to forest to worship \'Siva. Next, it has been known that the Dev\={\i} P\=arvat\={\i}, the part incarnate of the Great Mother, the Mother of the universe, the Supreme, and Perfect offered boons to \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a. How did it then come to pass that \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a, being himself the God, had to worship P\=arvat\={\i} and Mah\=adeva? Is it that \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a was inferior to Mah\=adeva and P\=arvat\={\i}? This is our doubt.''

6-7. S\=uta spoke :-- ``Hear then, the reasons, O noble \d{R}i\d{s}is! that I heard from Vy\=asa; I will now sing before you those meritorious deeds \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}\=a.'' The son of Par\={\i}k\d{s}it, the intelligent Janamejaya had also the same doubts that you now have, when he heard the story before from Vy\=asa; and he asked the same questions that you now ask.''

8-11. Janamejaya said :-- ``O son of Bhagavat\={\i}! I have heard from you much about the Supreme Goddess, the Highest Cause; still the doubts are not leaving me. O Fortunate One! Kri\d{s}\d{n}a the Deva of the Devas, the Vi\d{s}\d{n}u incarnate, worshipped Sambh\=u and had to perform dire penances; this is my great wonder! He is the soul of all the J\={\i}vas, the One Ruler and Lord of this world and He is able to confer all the Siddhis; how is it, then, that the Lord Hari had to perform very difficult asceticism like an ordinary mortal. He who is able to create this universe, moving and non-moving, He who is able to preserve and destroy it, why did He practise such a terrible penance.''

12-54. Vy\=asa said :-- ``True it has been said by you that V\=asudeva the Jan\=ardana, is the destroyer of the Daityas and He is able to create

and preserve the Devas and do all other acts for them. But the Great Lord assumed a human body; therefore he had to perform his duties like a man and observe the Var\d{n}a and \=A\'srama Dharmas pertaining to human beings. Respecting the elderly persons, worshipping the spiritual teachers, doing service to the Brahm\=a\d{n}as, adoring and propitiating the Devas, feeling sorrow at times of sorrow, feeling pleasure at times of happiness, feeling dejection or expressing censure or scandal, or having sexual intercourse with women, in other words, to feel lust, anger, greediness and other passions when their proper time arises. All these are natural to all human beings; how can, then, \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a though intrinsically of pure qualities, become Nirgu\d{n}a (devoid of human qualities) when he assumed a human body which is Sagu\d{n}a, i.e., with qualities. O Ruler of men! The extinction of the Y\=adava race by the curse of G\=andh\=ar\={\i}, the daughter of Subala, and the curse of a Br\=ahmi\d{n}, Kri\d{s}\d{n}a's leaving his human coil, the stealing away of his wives, the robbing of their wealth on the way by the dacoits of the \=Av\={\i}ra tribe, Arjuna's becoming powerless to hurl any weapons on those dacoits, Kri\d{s}\d{n}a's not knowing anything about the stealing away of Pradyumna and Aniruddha from his Dv\=ark\=a palace, these all correspond verily to exertions and failings appropriate to human bodies. Again the \d{R}i\d{s}i N\=ar\=aya\d{n}a is the part incarnate of Vi\d{s}\d{n}u, and V\=asudeva is the part incarnate of the \d{R}i\d{s}i N\=ar\=aya\d{n}a; hence what wonder is there, if V\=asudeva be seen to adore and propitiate \'Siva? \'Siva is the God of gods; and He is the Lord of all the causal bodies that exist; in the state of Su\d{s}upti (deep sleep). In this respect, \'Siva is the creator of Vi\d{s}\d{n}u and Vi\d{s}\d{n}u worships Him in this light. R\=ama, Kri\d{s}\d{n}a and others are all part incarnations of Vi\d{s}\d{n}u; so there is no wonder if they worship \'Siva. The letter A is Bhagv\=an Brahm\=a ; the letter ``U'' is Bhagv\=an Hari; the letter ``M'' is Bhagv\=an Rudra and the half letter m is Mahe\'svar\={\i}, the Supreme Mother of the universe. The sages, therefore, consider Vi\d{s}\d{n}u superior to Brahm\=a; they again consider Rudra superior to Vi\d{s}\d{n}u and M\=ahe\'svar\={\i} (Tur\={\i}ya State) again superior to Rudra. The speciality of the half letter is that it can never be uttered; it is the symbol of the Eternal Dev\={\i}. In all the \'S\=astras, therefore, the superiority of the Dev\={\i} is established. Vi\d{s}\d{n}u is superior to Brahm\=a; Rudra is superior to Vi\d{s}\d{n}u. Therefore no doubt can arise in Kri\d{s}\d{n}a's worshipping \'Siva. It is through the will of \'Siva that a second Rudra originated from the forehead of Brahm\=a to offer boons to him (i. e., to Brahm\=a). This second Rudra is venerable and entitled to all worship; what to speak of the First Rudra? O King! It is through the proximity of the Dev\={\i} that the importance and superiority of \'Siva is thus established. Thus the incarnations of Hari arise in yugas after yugas through the intervention of the Yoga

M\=ay\=a; so there is no need to discuss on this point. Why to Achyuta alone, to Brahm\=a and \'Siva also She gives troubles for getting involved into incarnations, She the Yoga M\=ay\=a who is indirectly, with the twinklings of Her eyes, creating, preserving and destroying this universe. It is the Yoga M\=ay\=a that caused Kri\d{s}\d{n}a to be transferred from his lying-in chamber to the village Vraja and then protected him in the house of the cowherd Nanda; afterwards took him to Mathur\=a for the destruction of Kamsa, whence he was led again out of Jar\=asandha's fear to the city Dv\=ark\=a. It is She that created from Her Ownself the eight N\=aik\=as (the leading mistresses) and also sixteen thousand and fifty women for the pleasure and enjoyment of Kri\d{s}\d{n}a Bhagw\=an, the incarnation of Ananta (Vi\d{s}\d{n}u Bhagav\=an); thus Kri\d{s}\d{n}a Bhagav\=an was made completely subservient to them just like a perfect slave. When a young woman, though she is alone, can bind a man down by the network of M\=ay\=a, like strong iron chain, what wonder is there that the sixteen thousand and fifty women would make Kri\d{s}\d{n}a play in their hands like a \'Suka bird and make him an instrument to serve any purpose that they liked. \'Sr\={\i} Kri\d{s}\d{n}a got himself so much under the control of Satyabh\=am\=a that He went gladly under her commands to Indra's heavens to get the P\=arij\=ata flowers. There he had to fight with Indra and subsequently stole away the P\=arij\=ata tree and gave it to Satyabh\=am\=a as a very valuable ornament to be kept in her room. Behold! The same Kri\d{s}\d{n}a, by His own prowess, defeated \'Si\'sup\=ala and others for the preservation of religion and then stole away Rukmi\d{n}\={\i}, the daughter of Bh\={\i}ma and afterwards married her as his legal wife; where is the rule, then observed that it is a sin to take away another's wife? Thus all embodied beings get themselves subdued by Ahamk\=ara and do acts, good or bad, confounded and deluded by the network of Moha that always drags one down below. From the M\=ul\=a Prakriti are born Brahm\=a, Vi\d{s}\d{n}u, and Hara and from the T\=amasic Ahamk\=ara of Prakriti is created this whole cosmos, moving and non-moving. The lotus-born Brahm\=a becomes free when he is free from Ahamk\=ara; otherwise He becomes engaged in this world affairs. When freed from this Ahamk\=ara, all the J\={\i}vas become free; and their houses, wealth, wives, sons and brothers are quite powerless to tie them down; but when bound by Ahamk\=ara, the J\={\i}vas come under their control. O king! This Ahamk\=ara is the cause bondage to all the beings; ``I am the doer, this work is done by my power; or this I will do myself'' thinking thus, the embodied beings fall themselves under this bondage. An earthen pot cannot be made without earth; no effects can be visible without a cause; consequently Vi\d{s}\d{n}u is preserving this universe, because of this Ahamk\=ara (imposed on

him by Prakriti). The human beings are always drowned in their cares and anxieties simply because they are bound by this Ahamk\=ara; when they become free from this Ahamk\=ara, their cares and anxieties at once vanish. Moha (delusion) comes out of Ahamk\=ara; world and the enjoyments thereof come out of Moha; otherwise how can it be accounted for, that Hari and others, the mine of all good and auspiciousness, take their several incarnations in various wombs? Neither Moha nor this world comes to those that are bereft of Ahamk\=ara. Men are of three kinds, S\=attvic, R\=ajasic, and T\=amasic; O king! Brahm\=a, Vi\d{s}\d{n}u and \'Siva are sprung respectively from the R\=ajasic, S\=attvic, and T\=amasic Ahamk\=aras. In these three, the three Ahamk\=aras are always to be found, so the Munis, that have realised the Real Essence, declare. They are all bound by this Ahamk\=ara; there is no doubt in this. The Pundits of dull intellect, and deluded by M\=ay\=a declare that Vi\d{s}\d{n}u takes various incarnations out of his own free will; for when it is seen that men of even inferior intellects do not entertain any desire to enter into the wombs, painful and terrible; how will Vi\d{s}\d{n}u, then, the Holder of the discus, like to come into this womb! The slayer of Madhu, the Vai\d{s}\d{n}avas say, entered all at once into the wombs of Kau\'saly\=a and Devak\={\i}, full of faeces and other dirty things, of His own free will. But you must think out what happiness can Madhus\=udana, quitting his Vaikuntha Heavens, attain in this womb, full of so many troubles, and where arise, like poisons, hundreds of cares and thoughts to torment an individual! Especially when it is seen that human beings perform asceticism, sacrifice Yaj\~nas and do various charities, that they would avoid thus entering in wombs, which is very painful and terrible. How can Bhagav\=an Vi\d{s}\d{n}u be called independent? If so, He would never have yielded to enter into various wombs. Therefore, O king! Know this that this whole universe is under the control of Yoga M\=ay\=a; the Devas, men, birds, what more everything from Brahm\=a down to a blade of grass are all under the control of Yoga M\=ay\=a. Brahm\=a, Vi\d{s}\d{n}u and Hara all are bound by the rope of Her M\=ay\=a. So they roam easily by Her M\=ay\=a from womb to womb like a spider.

Here ends the First Chapter of the Fifth Book on the superiority of R\=udra over Vi\d{s}\d{n}u in the Mah\=a Pur\=a\d{n}am of \'Sr\={\i}mad Dev\={\i} Bh\=agavatam by Mahar\d{s}i Veda Vy\=asa, consisting of eighteen thousand verses.
